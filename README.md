# concordance
Project for data structures class.
Takes two text files as input, a main text file and a stop words text file.
The program reads through the text files, using hash maps to create a concordance table, counting how many lines each word is used in.
Punctuation, numbers, and words from the stop file are filtered out and not included in the concordance table.
